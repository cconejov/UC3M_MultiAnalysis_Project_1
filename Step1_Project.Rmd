## Introduction data set

We have selected the [CRASH-2](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/crash2.html) data set provided by Vanderbilt School of Biostatistics for our project. It describes the outcome of a randomized controlled trial and economic valuation of the effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and transfusion requirement in bleeding trauma patients. Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in trauma patients undergoing surgery but is an expensive treatment option. The trial's objective was to assess the effects and cost-effectiveness of an early administration of this medication. 

Participants of the study were adults with, or at risk of, significant bleeding within 8 hours of injury. Sample randomization was determined by the allocation of an eight-digit sequence randomly generated by a computer. Patients and staff were masked to the treatment allocation of the tranexamic acid. The treatment variable is unfortunately unavailable in our data set since it is proprietary to those who performed the original research. Our data is therefore contains the observations of the control subset and the treatment. We have sent an email to request if sharing this variable is possible. If we receive the variable, we will include it in Step 2 of this assignment.

We have adjusted the original data set to remove some variables that were not relevant to our investigation. We have removed variables regarding the exact surgical procedures administered to patients, various IDs, and details on the patient outcome. We removed the health outcome columns because of complications regarding missing data, where the boolean structure of the columns relating to specific outcomes, like stroke or pulmonary embolism, left a large number of cases with missing values. Instead, we added a boolean variable for a general outcome of survival to assess the efficacy of the procedure, rather than looking at particular health outcomes in post-surgery for living patients.

We will be using variables regarding the sex, age, and injury of the patient as well as certain biometrics, like blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, details on surgical blood transfusion, and a boolean variable on the survival of the patient. Our selection provides us with a balance of continuous and categorical variables, many of which are boolean, with minimal complications due to missing data. In summary, the data set consists of $n = 9497$ observations, with 11 columns, which $p = 8$ are quantitative and 3 are qualitative.

Moreover, the normal ranges of the biometric measurements are also added, in order to have a point of comparison with the observations present in the data set and in this way determine if they are abnormal with respect to the normal metrics.

## Visual Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

First, we will review the distribution of the variables involved in the data set.

In the case of *age*, the Figure \ref{fig:age} reflects how this variable appears to be largely weighted to the left, with lower ages featuring more frequently than those that are greater, possibly reflecting that younger people often take more risk and work higher at-risk occupations, raising their chance of experiencing trauma involving bleeding.





```{r age, fig.cap = "Distribution of age variable\\label{fig:age}", echo=FALSE}
plothist(col_name = "age", df = X, ylabtext = "All participants",  color_1, density_plot = FALSE)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD

The Figure \ref{fig:injurytime} below shows the distribution of the variable Injury  (*injurytime*) We can see how this variable is highly skewed to the left with almost all values falling below ten minutes since the injury was experienced. This is likely due to the fact, that in cases of serious injury, victims are brought to the hospital quite quickly as is the case for this data set on trauma. We apply a *log* transformation to this variable `log_injurytime = log(injurytime + 1)`, similarly to many other variables we have, because of the weight of the variables to the left of the distribution, in order to make a more normalized distribution.After the *log* transformation, we can see that two observations remain quite distinct and far to the right, with a value of four. They appear as potential outliers to the distribution, as they have almost 4 times the median value.

plothistlog(col_name = "injurytime", colname_log = "log_injurytime" ,df = X, breaks_colname_log = 10, ylabtext = "All participants", color_1)
```



For *sbp* (systolic blood pressure), the distribution is a fairly centrally balanced distribution around 90 mmHg. Most observations around the mean and then a reasonably tight distribution of those who differ, making a distribution that is fairly Gaussian by nature. Furthermore, most people are fairly young in the sample and therefore would have rates, at a healthy level, that deviant less from the norm. The distribution is shown below in Figure \ref{fig:sbp}.



```{r sbp, fig.cap = "Distribution of sbp (Systolic Blood Pressure)\\label{fig:sbp}", echo=FALSE}
plothist(col_name = "sbp", df = X, ylabtext = "All participants",  color_1, density_plot = FALSE)
```

*Rr* (Respiratory Rate) appears, similar to sbp, to resemble a moderately balanced distribution around 22 respirations per minute, although *rr* is weighted more to the left. The distribution of this variable is showed in Figure \ref{fig:rr}. Taking a *log* transformation `log_rr = log(rr)`, we have the new distribution below as part of Figure \ref{fig:rr}. After the log transformation, the distribution remains quite spread out with a number fo values beyond the whiskers of the box plot. The *log* transformation in this case has not significantly changed the shape of the distribution, it does not shift much more towards a normal distribution after the *log* transformation.




```{r rr, fig.cap = "Distribution of rr (Respiratory Rate) and logrr\\label{fig:rr}", echo=FALSE}
plothistlog(col_name = "rr", colname_log = "log_rr" ,df = X, breaks_colname_log = 8, ylabtext = "All participants", color_1)
```

In the case of *hr* (Heart rate), Figure \ref{fig:hr} has a distribution that seems fairly balanced at around 110, similar to the variables above, like *sbp* and *rr*. However, many values remain outside the whiskers and the IQR is quite tight, showing most people fall within a tight range but there is a number of people who have irregular rates on either side. NOT A CANDIDATE FOR LOG?

However, many values remain outside the whiskers and the IQR is quite tight, showing most people fall within a tight range but there is a number of people who have irregular rates on either side.

plothist(col_name = "hr", df = X, ylabtext = "All participants",  color_1, density_plot = FALSE)
```

For *cc* (Central capillary refill time in seconds) has 75% of the observations below roughly 4 as we can appreciate in Figure \ref{fig:cc}. However, the distribution is right-skewed. As a result, we apply a *log* transformation `log_cc = log(cc)` that is given in the below part of Figure \ref{fig:cc}. The log has made the distribution more normal, and was quite successful in this case. There remains a number of observations to the far right of the distribution, which could be possible outliers as the represent values approximately three times the median. 



```{r cc, fig.cap = "Distribution of cc (Central capillary) and log transformation\\label{fig:cc}", echo=FALSE}
plothistlog(col_name = "cc", colname_log = "log_cc" ,df = X, breaks_colname_log = 8, ylabtext = "All participants", color_1)
```

The following Figure \ref{fig:ndaysicu} shows the distribution of the *ndaysicu:* variable. In this case, the distribution is heavily weighted to the left and right-skewed. Most patients it seems, with trauma injuries at high risk of bleeding, do not often need to remain in the hospital for long. The transformed distribution `log_ndaysicu = log(ndaysicu + 1)` is given in the below part of Figure \ref{fig:ndaysicu}. After the *log* transformation, this distribution doesn't appear much more Gaussian in nature. The values are still heavily weighted the left. No values appear outside the whiskers, however, therefore this leads us to believe that there is not much likelihood of outliers in this distribution.



```{r ndaysicu, fig.cap = "Distribution of ndaysicu and log transformation\\label{fig:ndaysicu}", echo=FALSE}
plothistlog(col_name = "ndaysicu", colname_log = "log_ndaysicu" ,df = X, breaks_colname_log = 10, ylabtext = "All participants", color_1)

```

Finally, the *ncell* distribution is weighted to the left with a median of 3 as we can see in the Figure \ref{fig:ncell}. The conclusion of this, is that many patients only need a small number of or zero units of red cell products transfused. Due to this variable being highly weighted to the left, we apply the *log* transformation  `log_ncell = log(ncell + 1)`. After the transformation, the variables visually appears to be more Gaussian, but a large number of values remain outside the whiskers on the right of the distribution. None, however, appear to be distinct enough from the others to be outliers.




```{r ncell, fig.cap = "Distribution of ncell\\label{fig:ncell}", echo=FALSE}
plothistlog(col_name = "ncell", colname_log = "log_ncell" ,df = X, breaks_colname_log = 8, ylabtext = "All participants", color_1)
```

Our primary categorical variable will be the distributions of *death*, where 0 represents people who surive and 1 for those who do not survive. The Figure \ref{fig:deaths}, shows that approximately for each death, 4 people survive. In the context of this problem, if we have an unbalanced proportion of people that survive, it can be considered as a sign that most people survive trauma injuries in the data set and that with the administration of the drug, most people survive . Although, this is not necessarily due to the treatment with the drug as both the control and treatment sample are contained in this data set, and were not separated (due to the absence of the treatment variable).


```{r deaths, fig.cap = "Distribution of deaths\\label{fig:deaths}", echo=FALSE}

  geom_bar(aes( x = death, fill = death)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of death") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c(color_3, color_2))
```

### Univariate Analysis by death - survival patients


Out next step is to study some relations of the quantitative variables in terms of our central categorical variable *death*. 


Figure \ref{fig:agedeath}, shows us that those who survive (0) are on average younger than those who do not survive, which is logical, as younger people likely fair better in trauma accidents where there is a risk of significant bleeding (which this trail assesses). Aside from the median being slightly smaller than for those who survive, the distributions are fairly similar with a scew to the right. Participants in this trial are on average are quite young, roughly 34.7, which could be due to sampling, but also because younger people are more likely to suffer from trauma accidents due to having jobs with an increased propensity of injury and also more general for risk taking behaviour. 



```{r agedeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of Age in terms of death\\label{fig:agedeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("age", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```



Figure \ref{fig:loginjurytimedeath} showing *log injury time* demonstrates that those who survive (1) have longer relative injury time on average. The IQR for those who survive is also wider as well as the whiskers. However, there are still values of longer injury times for those who do survive, however they appear less frequently. This is slightly counterintuitive as we would expect those who took longer to get to hospital or those who have been suffering longer, would be at a higher risk of *death*. However, it's possible that these people have less serious injuries, and have less risk of dying, and are then rushed to hospital with less urgency, having a longer injury time.



```{r loginjurytimedeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of the log injurytime in terms of death\\label{fig:loginjurytimedeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("log_injurytime", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```



Figure \ref{fig:sbpdeath} showing *sbp* (systolic blood pressure) against *death*, shows that those who survive (O), have distribution slightly to the right of that of the those who do not survive. This could be logical as those who survive have a higher blood pressure after the accident  then those who eventually do not, because their bodies are less weakened by the trauma.



```{r sbpdeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of sbp (Systolic Blood Pressure) in terms of death\\label{fig:sbpdeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("sbp", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```

Figure \ref{fig:loginjurytimedeath} compares *log respiratory rate* (rr) with those who do not survive (1) have a slightly higher mean than those who survive (1). This seems to lead us to believe, that those who do not survive, more often have a higher than an average respiratory rate. 



```{r logrrdeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of log transformation of rr (Respiratory Rate) in terms of death\\label{fig:logrrdeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("log_rr", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```


Figure \ref{fig:hrdeath}, similar to *log respiratory rate*, the distribution and median of *log heart rate* for those who do not survive (1) is slightly higher than who survive (0).



```{r hrdeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of hh (hearth Rate) in terms of death\\label{fig:hrdeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("hr", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```


Figure \ref{fig:logccdeath}, also resembling *log heart rate (hr)* and *log respiratory rate (rr)*, *log central capillary (cc)* (central capillary refill time in seconds) has a distribution further to the right, even more extreme than *hr* and *rr*, which could show that *cc* increases like *hr* and *rr* on average for people who will not survive. We also remain to see a limited number of observations to the the extreme right, which could be outliers. 




```{r logccdeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of log transformation of cc (Central capillary) in terms of death\\label{fig:logccdeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("log_cc", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```

Figure \ref{fig:logndaysicudeath} shows that days in the ICU (*ndaysicu*), has a very similar distribution with an identical median, likely due to the fact that most people who suffer from trauma injuries only spend a very limited relative amount of time in the ICU. We see that, for those who survive (0), the 75% quartile is slightly larger, and when reviewing the histogram, more observations are on the further right end of the spectrum (more relative days in hospital). This possibly indicates to us that those who are more likely to survive are kept in the ICU for longer to heal in some cases.




```{r logndaysicudeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of log ndaysicu in terms of death\\label{fig:logndaysicudeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("log_ndaysicu", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```




Figure \ref{fig:logncelldeath} shows the *log* value of  red blood cells transfused (*ncell*) accounting for *death*. Those who do not survive (1), have a broader distribution with the 75% quartile being larger, possibly indicating that for those who will not survive, more blood cells are transfused for more grave injuries that are less survivable.  



```{r logncelldeath, fig.cap = "Distribution of log ncell in terms of death\\label{fig:logncelldeath}", echo=FALSE}
plothist_factor("log_ncell", "death", X, "Death", color_2, color_3, density_plot = FALSE)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD


Finally, the scatter plots in Figure 18 do not show any significant relationships between the variables, while accounting for *death*. There does not seem to be any recognizable visual relationship between any of the variables that is outstanding. 




![Scatter plot of all quantitiative variables](figure_output/pairs_death.png)



The PCP plot in Figure 19, generally matches with our observations about the scatter plots. Those who survive and do not, follow the same visual pattern. For *log_cc*, *hr*, and *log_ndaysicu*, those who survive appear to have values that are more broadly dispersed, but this could be due to the fact those who survive represent a majority of the sample size, making the visual depiction incorrect. Although, comparing with the histograms and box plots, *log_cc*, *hr*, and *log_ndaysicu* do appear to have more dispersed distributions and wider IQRs. 




![PCP plot of all quantitiative variables](figure_output/pcp_death.png)



The Andrews' plot in Figure 20, matches our previous analysis in Figure 23 and 24, that variables share similar distributions and relationships when accounting for *death*. The Andrew Plot does not show any dramatic differences in the depction between the two groups.

In conclusion, we see that when accounting for different categorical variables and *death*, the relationships between our quantitative variables do not change significantly overall, looking at the scatter plots and other visuals. There doesn't appear to be any collinearity, whether *death* is accounted for or not. We can see some minor changes in distributions and means when dividing the distribution for those who do not and do survive, however there is nothing too drastic. The IQRs for all our variables overlap, for example. The medians are even the same for *log_ncell* and *log_ndaysicu*. The variable with the largest difference, appear to be , *log_cc* where the median for those survive is at the 25% quartile of those who do not survive. For *sbp*, the median for those who do not survive is similar to the 25% quartile of those who survive.   


In the next section we will make inferences using sample estimators of mean, covariance, and correlation.

m <- colMeans(X_quan)

      row.names = FALSE,

Now provided is the sample mean for the variables when the patient survives, or when *death* = 0.



```{r, echo=FALSE}

m_life <- colMeans(X_life)

knitr::kable(t(m_life),

      align="c")
```



<<<<<<< HEAD


Although touched upon above in our analysis of the box plots and histograms, comparing the means when controlling for *death*, overall, we do see some differences in the variables. The means of those who survive are more similar to the overall sample mean as those who survive represent more of the sample population.  In terms of difference between means we see that *age* is slightly higher for those who do not survive, which is logical, as those who are younger will likely be of better overall health and survive a trauma.*Hr*, *log_rr*, *log_cc* and *log_ncell* are all higher, and *sbp* lower,  for those who do not survive which could be various responses related to the bodies response to more serious injury and it's medical treatment (more blood given, for example). *Log_injurytime* and *log_ndaysicu* are higher for those who survive, possibly as those who have less serious injuries have a higher likelihood to survive and take longer to get to hospital. For similar reasons, *log_ndaysicu* could be longer for those who survive as those with more serious injuries were not able to survive for long, but those who could survive stayed longer in the ICU.

Comparing covariance matrices is a bit challenging as the magnitudes are not standarised, hence we reserve much our analysis of the covariances between variables to the correlation matrices below, where the values are standarised between -1 and 1. We can analyse the difference in the  individual variances of the variables when accounting for *death* here as this information is lost in the correlation matrices. To do this we use another additional measure of dispersion is called the *generalized variance*, which is defined as the determinant of the sample covariance. In the case of the three previous covariance table, the generalized variance is given by the following table. The generalized variance appears to be highest for the entire population, which is logical as it has the highest sample size and contains both groups for *death*. Surprisingly, the variance for those who do not survive (1) is the significantly higher than for those who survive (0), despite having a drastically smaller sample size. This leads us to believe that data for those who do not survive is much more widely spread, possibly demonstrating that their indicators differ, many being related to health, are further from the median, or standard, healthy levels, indicating less likelihood to survive. In fact, we see a higher variance only in those who survive for the only two indicators that are not related to biological measurements in *log_ndaysicu* 
and *log_injurytime* (although very marginally in this case). As noted previously, *log_ndaysicu* could vary more for those who survive as those who do not survive may have more serious injuries where they are not able to make it to ICU treatment. It's possible that those who enter the ICU they are more likely to survive after entering despite how long they spend there.

Reviewing Figure \ref{fig:corr} for the general sample covariance matrix we see that most values are fairly close to zero meaning most variables do not have a linear correlation. The maximum absolute value we see is the correlation between *log_ncell* and *log_ndaysicu* at 0.3113. Other correlation coefficients that exceed the absolute value of 0.1 are *log_ndaysicu* and *log_injurytime*, *sbp* and *log_injurytime*, *log_rr* and *hr* as well as *hr* and *sbp* at -0.2225. This is expected as our scatter plots did not visually reveal any linear relationships. According to Ratner (2009), correlation coefficients with values below 0.3 are considered weak or minimal relationships. All of our correlation coefficients are within this category. *Log_ncell* and *log_ndaysicu* are the only ones to reach the threshold of a "moderate relationship". The fact that *log_ncell* and *log_ndaysicu* have a limited moderate relationship could be possibly be due to that fact those who stay in hospital for longer need more blood and those who have serious injuries need more blood and need to stay in hospital more often. We very small positive correlations between most variables but appears that *sbp* has minor negative correlations with most variables as well as *hr*, although these correlations remain minor.

Figure \ref{fig:corrgroup} are the correlation matrices while accounting for *death*, as well as, the Figure 22 which is a heatmap for the differences in the correlations.



```{r heatmap, fig.cap = "Heatmap difference between correlation atrices\\label{fig:heatmap}", echo=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
corrplot(R_death, title="Did not survive")
corrplot(R_life, title="Survived")
```



We do not see any major changes in relationships for those who do not survive and people that do. Some variances do increase for those who survive such as *log_ndaysicu* and *log_ncell*,  which almost doubles, and rises to a level of correlation at 0.3493 -  considered moderate (Ratner, 2009). This may be because, for those that do not survive, they receive a lot of blood to attempt to save their lives, but do not survive long enough to stay in the ICU due to the severity of their trauma. This therefore would limit the covariance. For those who survive, they possibly could remain in hospital longer therefore, receiving more blood over those days, increasing the covariance.


In conclusion, there is not much colinearity in these variables, while controlling for *death* or when not. This would mean, for example, that there is good potential for regression for the overall sample. However, though and more salient for our analysis at hand. the two categories for *death* are not easily separated, which means that drawing conclusions about the two separate groups, and comarping them, would be difficult and any statistical analysis would likely not be very accurate in drawing conclusions about the groups.


### Outliers


Through out our analysis, we did not have much reason to believe that outliers strongly affected our variables, we recognized some possibility in *cc* as well as *injurytime*.  To compute the robust means we use the Minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimators for the robust mean as we have many more observations ($n = 9497$) than quantitative variables ($p=8$) (it also the reason why we did not perform shrinkage analysis). However, despite making many of variable's distribution appear close to a Gaussian distribution our analysis with the MCD may be slightly flawed due the fact that some of our variables are not Gaussian, even after transformation. Comparing the robust means to the regular we don't see any dramatic differences, confirming our analysis. For *cc* and *injurytime* we don't see much difference in fact, although these distributions are not Gaussian possibly diluting our ability to analyze. The largest differences are between *log_ndaysicu* and *log_ncell* although they are less than 0.05 of relative change (on the log transformed variables). Overall, it appears that outliers are not very influential for any of variables.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
MCD_est <- CovMcd(X_quan, alpha=0.75, nsamp="deterministic")
m_MCD <- MCD_est$center

knitr::kable(t(m_MCD),
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = "Sample robust mean",
      align="c")

knitr::kable(t(m),
      row.names = FALSE,
      caption = "Sample mean",
      align="c")

```



Comparison of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for sample and robust (MCD) means are given by Figure \ref{fig:robust}. This plot confirms our suspicions from above that above that outliers do not effect the variables strongly as the eigenvalues for the two estmiates do not differ strongly.



```{r robust, fig.cap = "Comparison eigenvalues sample and robust covariance\\label{fig:robust}", echo=FALSE}
S_MCD <- MCD_est$cov
R_MCD <- cov2cor(S_MCD)
eval_S <- eigen(S)$values
eval_S_MCD <- eigen(S_MCD)$values

min_y <- min(cbind(eval_S,eval_S_MCD)) - 1
max_y <- max(cbind(eval_S,eval_S_MCD)) + 1

plot(1:8,
     eval_S,
     col=color_1,
     type="b",
     xlab="Number",
     ylab="Eigenvalues",
     pch=19,
     ylim=c(min_y,max_y),
     main="Comparison of eigenvalues")
points(1:8,
       eval_S_MCD,
       col=color_2,
       type="b",
       pch=19)
legend(5,600,
       legend=c("Eigenvalues of S","Eigenvalues of S MCD"),
       col=c(color_1,color_2),
       lty=1,
       cex=1.2)
```




Analyzing the correlation plots for the sample and MCD estimator, we have further evidence that outliers are not important in our analysis, as the correlations hardly change. Some of the correlations appear stronger but this is only marginally, and doesn't provide sufficient support to conclude that outliers would be influential in our analysis using any of our variables. We therefore end our examination of outliers here as further investigation will likely not be helpful as outliers do not seem to be important.

## Principal Component Analysis

We can divide our quantitative variables in three categories:

1. Individual factors

  i) Age
  ii) injurytime

2. Biometrics

  i) sbp
  ii) rr
  iii) cc
  iv) hr

3. Medical attention

  i) ndaysicu
  ii) ncell


Then, we will discriminate how the principal components uses this variables.

## PCA Complete dataset

In figure 25, we plot the first 2 PC. In this case, there is approximately 40% of the variance explained with these two principal components

In green color, there is the survival patients and orange is the death patients. Is is difficult to see a clear sepatations between both populutions. In the same, there is no linear relationship between these two  groups.

![First two PCs based on the sample covariance all population](figure_output/pca_death.png)

On the other hand, we will analize the weights of the fist two principal components. This can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:l1pc}. For the case of the first PC (Left), the largest positive value are associated with the specfic variable of *sbp*. Some studies, for example [Banegas et all](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11896505/) and [Kurl et all](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/hs0901.095395) suggest that Systolic blood pressure is a more frequent cardiovascular risk factor than other blood related measures and can be used in order to detect future diseases. So, it appears that this principal components reflects these effect for the patients.

In the case of the second Principal component (Right) the largest positive value with the medical attention and injury time. It suggets that previous you receive medical attention, it is possible that you can have more chance for survival.

On the other hand, when we consider the loadings for the first two PCs (figure \ref{fig:l3pc}) that larges value in magnitude are associated with the sbp pressure and medical attention.

It is important to notice the inverse relation between sbp and other biometric measures. For example

* [Herakova et all](https://clinicalhypertension.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40885-017-0071-3) report that  in general deep breathing could reduce blood pressures (BP). So we 

* [Harvard Heart Letter](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-heart-rate-affect-blood-pressure)  reports that an *isolated increase in blood pressure can drop the heart rate a little*

```


Finally figure 28 reflects the PC scores and PC loadings. In this case, it is difficult to make conclusions due to the numbers of observed individuals, but we can make the following assevarations:

* There is a strong positive relation between age and injury time.

* There is no relation between the ndaysicu with the biometrical measures as sbp and hr. It makes sense, because this is a variable more related with the medical attention, as can be appreciated with the variables *ncell* and *injurytime*

![PC Scores and PC loading all population](figure_output/pca_biplot.png)

The figure \ref{fig:pcaeigv} shows the explained variance of the eigenvalue. We see that the first 4 principal components explains approximately 63% of the model.

Finally figure \ref{fig:corrpc} explain the correlation between the variables and the principal components. IN the case of tghe first principal components, in magnitude the biometrical measures and medical attention variables are the more related with them.  In the case of the second principal component, the individual factors such age and injury time adquire more relevance in the analisis.

In case of age this i more influential in PC4, and it can explain the right orange points in figure 35.
